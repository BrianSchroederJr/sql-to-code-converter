# sql-to-code-converter
Convert SQL to C# (and other languages) and C# to SQL with the click of a button

This is a simple Microsoft HTML Application(HTA) that converts SQL to a code ready string by adding double quotes and plus signs to each line making it easy to quickly modify your SQL code to be used in a C#, Java, or any other language that uses C# style strings to define an SQL query.  The program also transforms the code in the opposite direction allowing you to quickly clean up program code to be run directly on an SQL server.
